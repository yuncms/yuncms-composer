Usage
-----

The Yii 2 Composer Installer is automatically installed with when installing the framework via Composer.

To use Yii 2 composer installer, simply set the package `type` to be `yii2-extension` in your `composer.json`,
like the following:

```json
{
    "type": "yii2-extension",
    "require": {
        "yiisoft/yii2": "~2.0.0"
    },
    ...
}
```

You may specify a bootstrapping class in the `extra` section. The `init()` method of the class will be executed each time
the Yii 2 application is responding to a request. For example,

```json
{
    "type": "yii2-extension",
    ...,
    "extra": {
        "yuncms": {
            "name": "admin",
            "i18n": {
                "class":"yii\\i18n\\PhpMessageSource",
                "basePath":"@yuncms/admin/message"
            },
            "migrationNamespace": "yuncms\\admin\\migrations",
            "backend": {
                "class": "yuncms\\admin\\Module"
            },
            "frontend": {}
        }
    }
}
```
